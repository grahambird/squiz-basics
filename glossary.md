# Glossary

Turning Squiz speak into English.

## Asset
Any item in the system (content, users, folders, templates, images, you name it).

## Backend
Not so user friendly administration interface.

## Context
Alternative versions of the same asset. The system starts with one context. Additional contexts can be added to allow authors to publish in multiple languages, for example.

## Design file
The page template. Can be used to generate HTML pages but also any other text-based format.

## Easy Edit Suite
See Edit+.

## Edit+
JavaScript-powered user friendly authoring environment.

## Metadata schema
Think "custom fields". Metadata schemas are applied to assets to supplement their native fields.

## Paint layout
These are effectively "asset templates" but can also be used as MVC-like controllers to abstract away complexity into multiple files.

## Trigger
Very powerful and flexible event-based actions. Can be used to make changes to the current asset on save, for example.

## Workflow
The system includes a totally customisable content workflow feature with email notifications. Branching can be based on many things including asset metadata which makes it very powerful.
